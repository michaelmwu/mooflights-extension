# Development

## Setup

```sh
bun install --frozen-lockfile
```

## Build And Load

```sh
bun run build
```

Then open Chrome or another Chromium-compatible browser:

1. Go to `chrome://extensions`.
2. Enable Developer Mode.
3. Click "Load unpacked".
4. Select this repo's `dist/` directory.
5. Open `https://matrix.itasoftware.com/`.

For iterative work:

```sh
bun run dev
```

`bun run dev` creates a dev build and watches source files. Reload the unpacked extension after rebuilds.

For a one-shot dev build:

```sh
bun run build:dev
```

Dev builds expose an options-page "Developer Backend" section for pointing the extension at a locally running API such as `http://localhost:3000`. Production builds hide this section.

For Firefox:

```sh
bun run build:firefox
```

Then open Firefox:

1. Go to `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`.
2. Click "Load Temporary Add-on...".
3. Select `dist-firefox/manifest.json`.
4. Open `https://matrix.itasoftware.com/`.

For a watch build, use:

```sh
bun run dev:firefox
```

Prefer a stable high port for the backend when you are not intentionally running multiple backend worktrees:

```env
PORT=48731
APP_URL=http://localhost:48731
```

Then set the extension dev backend URL to `http://localhost:48731`. If Conductor assigns a different worktree port, use the custom URL field in the Developer Backend section.

## Checks

```sh
bun run check
bun run typecheck
bun run test
```

## Packaging

```sh
bun run package
```

This writes versioned packages such as `artifacts/mooflights-0.0.8.zip` and `artifacts/mooflights-0.0.8.crx`. The CRX step requires Google Chrome or Chromium; set `CHROME_BIN` if it is not in a standard location. Set `MOOFLIGHTS_CRX_KEY_PATH` or `MOOFLIGHTS_CRX_KEY_B64` when a stable CRX key is needed; otherwise Chrome generates a throwaway package key during packaging. Legacy `MU_TRAVEL_*` packaging variables are still accepted for existing local setups.

For Firefox development packaging:

```sh
bun run package:firefox
```

This writes `artifacts/mooflights-firefox-<version>.xpi`. The generated Firefox package is unsigned; release distribution
still needs the Mozilla Add-ons signing flow.

To prepare the next unused patch release version from the latest local `vX.Y.Z` tag or checked-in version:

```sh
bun run release:next-patch
```

To prepare that version and package it in one step:

```sh
bun run release:package:next-patch
```

To prepare the next unused minor release version, such as `0.1.0` after `0.0.x`:

```sh
bun run release:next-minor
```

To prepare that minor version and package it in one step:

```sh
bun run release:package:next-minor
```

Before cutting a release, keep `package.json` and `src/manifest.json` versions in sync:

```sh
bun run release:verify
```

## GitHub Workflows

- `CI`: runs on pull requests and pushes to `main`; installs with Bun, runs Biome, typecheck, tests, and production build.
- `Release Extension Package`: runs manually or on `v*` tags; verifies the repo, checks the release tag matches the extension version when provided, builds versioned Chrome `artifacts/mooflights-*.zip` and `artifacts/mooflights-*.crx` packages plus the Firefox `artifacts/mooflights-firefox-*.xpi` package, uploads the package artifacts, generates GitHub release notes from the tag history, and attaches the packages to a single GitHub release for that source version. Manual runs can omit `release_tag` to build only, use the default `next_patch` strategy to package the next unused patch version as a build artifact, choose `next_minor` for a `0.1.0`-style bump, or provide an existing `vX.Y.Z` tag to create/update a draft release.

The release workflow intentionally does not publish to the Chrome Web Store or sign Firefox packages yet. Until Mu Travel
LLC has the relevant store automation credentials, store submission and Mozilla Add-ons signing remain manual and outside
GitHub Actions. The Firefox XPI attached to GitHub releases is unsigned and intended for Mozilla Add-ons submission or
developer testing.

Neither workflow needs backend secrets. The extension build must not read `.env`.

## Stable Unpacked Extension Path

Browsers key unpacked-extension storage to the loaded extension identity, and loading a build directory from a different
Conductor workspace can make the browser treat it as a different extension. To keep settings while archiving and
recreating workspaces, use the stable build targets:

```sh
bun run dev:stable
bun run dev:firefox:stable
```

In a linked worktree, these write to the canonical repo root `dist/` and `dist-firefox/` directories instead of the
workspace-local build directories. Load the canonical `dist/` once in Chrome and the canonical `dist-firefox/` once in
Firefox, then reload those extensions after workspace builds. The checked-in Conductor Run script uses
`bun run dev:stable` and is marked non-concurrent so two workspaces do not race to write the same Chrome extension
directory. Use the Firefox stable script with the same non-concurrent expectation if you add it to Conductor.

## Browser Extension Notes

- `src/manifest.json` is the Chrome MV3 source manifest.
- `bun run build` writes the Chrome MV3 build to `dist/`.
- `bun run build:firefox` writes a Firefox build to `dist-firefox/`.
- The Firefox build rewrites the manifest to MV2 with an event-page background script because Firefox continues to
  support MV2 and older local Firefox builds do not run Chrome-style MV3 background service workers.
- Content scripts are bundled as IIFEs because Chrome loads them as plain files from the manifest.
- The Chrome background service worker is bundled as ESM; the Firefox event-page background is bundled as an IIFE.
- Popup and options pages are static HTML files plus bundled React entrypoints.
- Static data that must work offline belongs in `src/shared/data/`.
- Backend debugging still goes through HTTP API endpoints. Do not put `POSTGRES_URL` or direct database credentials into extension settings.
